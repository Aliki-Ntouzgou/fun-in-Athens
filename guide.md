The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous historical monument in Greece. It was constructed in the mid 5th century BC, also known as the Golden Century of Athens. Although the most famous building on the Acropolis is the Parthenon, there are many other buildings, like the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike. The Acropolis was entirely made of the finest Pentelic marble and by the best craftsmen of the era. Along the centuries that followed, it was largely destroyed by wars. The greatest destructions were in 1687 by a Venetian gun, and in 1816 when Lord Elgin removed many parts of the Parthenon frieze.

The Erechtheion is an ancient Greek temple located on the north side of the Acropolis. The temple was erected in 421-406 BC and was dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon. In particular, the eastern part of the building was dedicated to Athena Polias, while the western part served the cult of Poseidon-Erechtheus and held the altars of Hephaistus and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus.

On the north side of the temple, there is the famous "Porch of the Maidens", with six sculpted female figures (Caryatids) serving as supporting columns. Five of them are in the Acropolis Museum and the last one in the British Museum; those on the building are casts.
