Here are the best places where you can enjoy the Greek food.

**TELI'S CHOPS**

<img src="media/tbtt.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

"TELI'S CHOPS", or in Greek, "Œ§Œë ŒúŒ†Œ°ŒôŒñŒüŒõŒëŒöŒôŒë Œ§ŒüŒ• Œ§ŒïŒõŒó", is a very good hidden tavern, with only one main dish. Chops. You get in, and they just ask you how many portions to bring on table. They also serve a legendary dish as an appetizer with tomato, peppers (spicy and not) & feta cheese, all grilled, just for free. Of course fried potatoes are served with the chops. Telis's tavern started its functioning since 1977 and is still the best of its kind. A portion costs almost 10 euros but it's totally worth its money (you satiate for good). But be careful not to be confused with the real tavern, because some unfair competitors have opened a chop-shop right next to the original, with the name "Telis"! The real one is the one on your right, as you see both taverns. Anyway, words are not enough to describe the taste. We suggest you going at least one time, and you won't lose. And just a tip of advice. If you go, when the order comes in table, do not post a picture of it on any social media or something like that. You will ruin it's magicness.

Loukoumades are little bite-sized fluffy sweet honey balls which are deep fried to golden and crispy perfection. They are served soaked in hot honey syrup or perhaps with cinnamon and garnished with chopped walnuts or you can have it with your favourite garnish. LukuŒúŒëŒîŒïŒ£ is a must place to visit so you can try our most traditional pastry!

**Nancy's Sweet Home**

If you are a fan of sweets, that's the place for you! So many different options, but all so delicious! Being such a huge fan of chocolate, I strongly recommend it, but even if you are not so into chocolate you can find all kinds of sweets there! Juicy chocolate pies, hellish strawberry pies, southern kazan dip and many more are waiting for you. The most relaxing and sweet Candy Store in Athens is located at Psyri, really close to the Monastiraki Square.

## <a name="tours"></a>Tours

In order to enjoy the beauty of the city, you have to walk. So here are some tours worth doing.

**Monastiraki**

Stroll around the picturesque Monastiraki and Plaka neighbourhoods
Feel the atmosphere of "old Athens" and get the touch of history on the pedestrian streets.
It‚Äôs hard to imagine how many different experiences can fit in two neighbourhoods of a city centre! Archaeological sites, little arrays, old beautiful houses, antique shops and pittoresque cafes live together in the neighbourhoods of old Athens.
Plaka is full of people, colours and music! With the ‚Äútavernas‚Äù (typical Greek restaurants), the little shops, the cosy caf√©s, you will feel like playing in a movie of the ‚Äô60s. Don't miss out!

**Koukaki**

<img src="media/koukaki.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

This residential neighborhood, located at the foot of the Acropolis and the Filopappou Hill, is a combination of authenticity, convenience and entertainment. One of Koukaki‚Äôs highlights is the blend of architectural styles it contains. With its mismatch of neoclassical houses, low-rise buildings dating from the 1930s and post-1970s apartment blocks, Koukaki includes small shops, traditional restaurants, art galleries, museums and colorful bars and cafes. After a leisurely stroll around the streets, you can be sure to always find a caf√© with a couple of tables and chairs set up outside where we suspect your coffee break will quickly turn into an impromptu lunch. Whether you are on your own or with friends, looking to celebrate a special occasion or simply want to hang, Koukaki has it all.

**Thisseio**

<img src="media/thisseio.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Picture-perfect Thisseio is an ideal district for relaxing strolls and evening walks with views over century-old monuments. In addition to Filopappou Hill, the pedestrian street of Dyonisus Areopagitou and the lines of street vendors selling crafts and jewelry are just some of the highlights. Green, quiet and charming, Thisseio has also its fair share of caf√©s, bars and restaurants, where during the warm days, you can find a quiet corner on a terrace to enjoy a great book or an intense conversation with your friends. And just when you thought you knew everything about Thisseio, it surprises you with its small collection of museums, such as the Herakleidon Museum of Visual Arts, housed in a neoclassical mansion, or the "Stoa of Attalos Museum", located in the Ancient Agora.

## <a name="monuments"></a>Monuments

Athens is famous for its history and its numerous monuments and museums, you don't want to miss that part.

**Acropolis**
>The most famous historical monument in Greece

<img src="media/acropolis.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous historical monument in Greece. It was constructed in the mid 5th century BC, also known as the Golden Century of Athens. Although the most famous building on the Acropolis is the Parthenon, there are many other buildings, like the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike. The Acropolis was entirely made of the finest Pentelic marble and by the best craftsmen of the era. Along the centuries that followed, it was largely destroyed by wars. The greatest destructions were in 1687 by a Venetian gun, and in 1816 when Lord Elgin removed many parts of the Parthenon frieze.

**Parthenon**

<img src="media/parthenon.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

This magnificent temple on the Acropolis of Athens was built between 447 and 432 BCE in the Age of Pericles, and was dedicated to goddess Athena, the city's patron. It was designed by architects Iktinos and Kallikrates, while the sculptor Pheidias supervised the entire building process and conceived the temple's sculptural decoration and [chryselephantine statue of Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena_Parthenos). The temple is considered to be the epitome of Classical Greece.

**Erechtheion**

<img src="media/erechtheion.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The Erechtheion is an ancient Greek temple located on the north side of the Acropolis. The temple was erected in 421-406 BC and was dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon. In particular, the eastern part of the building was dedicated to Athena Polias, while the western part served the cult of Poseidon-Erechtheus and held the altars of Hephaestus and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus.

On the north side of the temple, there is the famous "Porch of the Maidens", with six sculpted female figures (Caryatids) serving as supporting columns. Five of them are in the Acropolis Museum and the last one in the British Museum; those on the building are casts.

**Temple of Poseidon**

<img src="media/templeofposeidon.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

*Photo taken from:* [GreekTravelPages](https://www.gtp.gr/TDirectoryDetails.asp?ID=14990)

One of the most stunning views all over Greece as well as a monument difficult to forget. Located at the southernmost tip of Attica the Temple of Poseidon is build to impress and educate us about history. Stories around this temple involve King Menelaus who stopped there on his way back from Troy and King Aegeus who had the unfortunate fate of drowning on that spot, thus giving his name to the Aegean Sea.

Organizing a trip to the Temple of Poseidon is worth your time but making the most of your trip is also important by swimming on the beach, underneath the monument, getting an astonishing experience of clear blue waters.

**Hiking**

Going hiking is a great way to explore and get to know Athens! There are a lot of places ideal for a hiking adventure!
1. Sounion National Park

<img src="media/sounionpark.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Sounion is most known for Poseidon's mighty temple and its magnificent sunsets. Lying about 50km south-east of Athens, the  Sounion National Park hosts relics of ancient silver, lead and zinc mines, as well as cave fossils unique to the whole of Greece. Inside the park you will find a magnificent and easy trail which starts near the Agios Konstantinos village(you will usually find a parking spot there), it surrounds the dramatic Chaos gulch (a collapsed ancient cave), it continues briefly on tarmac and then the view opens and you can see the city of Lavrion as well as the islands of Makronisos and Kea. The path arrives at the church of Agia Triada, where you will find natural spring water. From there, a dirty old road will lead you to the ancient mines' washing plants and tanks and then you will come across Kitsios cave. Finally, north of Poseidon's temple you will fing the rocky outcrops of Mavro Lithari and Vasilopoula.

**Lycabettus hill**

<img src="media/lycabettus.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Lycabettus hill is the highest point in the center of Athens. At the top of the hill, you can dine in the restaurant and visit the church of Agios Georgios. There are 3 ways to reach the top:

1. Climbing up the hill on foot, which is a long climb but not so difficult one.
2. Cable car if hiking and climbing isn't your thing. I would recommend that you take the cable car to get to the top and then go down on foot.
3. Car by following Lycabettus ring road, you will reach the end of the road with a huge parking lot and lot of people hanging out there. Next to the parking lot is the open theater of Lycabettus, where concerts and theatrical performances take place during summer.

No matter what you choose, you must be sure for one thing. You will enjoy the breathtaking panoramic view of Athens.
